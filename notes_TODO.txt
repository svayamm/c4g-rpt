- To clone from GitHub, first install GitLFS (Large File System).

- To run: Install latest version of ruby, run 'bundle install' from containing folder, run 'rails server'

- Currently, model is trained using RandomForest model generated in R. Model is 
stored in 'rpt_rf.pmml' file. To generate new file, follow this tutorial: 
https://github.com/asafschers/scoruby/wiki/Random-Forest
& https://medium.com/@aschers/deploy-machine-learning-models-from-r-research-to-ruby-go-production-with-pmml-b41e79445d3d 

If you would instead like to implement a different model, ML frameworks for Ruby
can be found here: https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning 

- Add validations in models (currently datatypes, values, etc. not validated)

- Currently, params for result (pages#show) not filtered - add proper whitelist 
for params

- 'Generate prediction' on Finance#show could be converted to AJAX JavaScript 
fn.; so result appears on same page...

- Certain commodity indicies appear to be missing in 'msp.csv' (Minimum Support 
Price for a commodity for a given year) file - If that can be corrected, 
'test2.rb' file & pages_controller should be modified to use actual values in 
generating profit prediction.

- Original 'classify_script' made use of Java SE 6 Legacy, Jruby, & Weka-jruby 
gem. Script runs fine on its own, but cannot be called in pages_controller (due 
to issues with Java/Jruby/Rubygems bindings). You can run it separately using 
'$ java -jar jruby.jar classify_script.rb fin.arff' -- this model is built 
using Weka's RandomForest model, which appears to be more accurate than the 
Scoruby implementation. Script outputs to 'myfile.txt'. To update data used in 
this model, use Weka to convert an updated csv into an .arff file.
